# Accept queue automatically on League of Legends.
I was inspired by the lucassmonn code
[accept-queue-lol-telegram](https://github.com/lucassmonn/accept-queue-lol-telegram), and I modify it according to my needs.

# Uncompiled version
You will have to follow the installation for everything to work.  
Prefer the [compiled version](https://github.com/reusteur73/LoL-queue-Acceptor-windows), no installation required to simplify the task.

# Installation

Please read this â–º [How to setup](https://github.com/reusteur73/LoL-queue-Acceptor-windows#how-to-setup-accept-match-button).

# Usage

Just run run.cmd and queue up! :-)
